# Predicting_Diabetes_Using_Logistic_Regression

## Overview
This project implements Logistic Regression to predict diabetes in Indian patients using key medical attributes. The analysis involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation, aiming to enhance early detection and diagnosis through machine learning.

## Dataset Information
- Dataset Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Pima Indians Diabetes
- The dataset contains patient records with attributes like glucose levels, BMI, insulin resistance, and age, crucial for assessing diabetes risk.
## Objective
- Develop a predictive model using Logistic Regression.
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover key patterns in diabetes diagnosis.
- Improve healthcare analytics by leveraging machine learning for early detection.
## Tech Stack & Tools
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization
- GitHub for version control and project collaboration
